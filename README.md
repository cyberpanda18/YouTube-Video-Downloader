# YouTube-Video-Downloader

This code asks you to enter the share link of the Youtube Video you wish to download and the location on your device where you want to download the video.
After getting the required inputs, the code searches for stream link of 720p or above and **download** the required video. If the stream of higher quality is not available, it automatically downloads the video of '360p' quality.
This is a simple code that uses PyTube, the Python library for YouTube.
